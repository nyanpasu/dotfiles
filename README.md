## Notes

some directories need to be copied manually since the files within change and
sync does not copy anything recursively
should be very careful running that command if i haven't updated this repo in a while :s
also, nobody else should really be using this for anything

###.vimrc
Uses [Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)

Requires you to make ~/swp

###.weechat
Requires python+ruby+lua support for scripts
