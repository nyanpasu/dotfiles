##.zshrc
Breakdown of what it does:
- Assigns modern keyboard keys (HOME/END/PGUP/PGDOWN etc.)
- Allows you to do bash-like movements (ctrl+<left/right> to move between words)
- Sets up vim as an editor, so you can ^[ to execute vi-like commands
- Enables colours for various coreutils
- Syntax highlighting
- Powerline prompt
- Better auto completion

##.vimrc
~~Requires [vundle](www.github.com/gmarik/vundle)~~
Requires [Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) for plugin management

##.emacs
Still pretty vanilla

##.weechat
Assumes you have python+ruby+lua support

##.config/bspwm
Tiling window manager I currently use. Probably switching soon.

##.config/sxhkd
The hotkey daemon that was pretty much developed alongside bspwm and goes
pretty well together.

##.config/termite/config
The term emulator I use, contains my colourschemes and old fonts.
