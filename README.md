# Dotifles
Personal dotfiles accumulated over time.

## Files
###.vimrc
Requires [vundle](www.github.com/gmarik/vundle)

###.emacs
Still pretty vanilla

###.weechat
Assumes you have python+ruby+lua support as well as the iset script installed.

###.zshrc

Breakdown of what it does:
- Assigns modern keyboard keys (HOME/END/PGUP/PGDOWN etc.)
- Allows you to do bash-like movements (ctrl+<left/right> to move between words)
- Sets up vim as an editor, so you can ^[ to execute vi-like commands *in zsh*
- Enables colours for various coreutils

###.config/bspwm
Tiling window manager I currently use.

###.config/sxhkd
The hotkey daemon that was pretty much developed alongside bspwm and goes
pretty well together.

###.config/termite/config
The term emulator I use, contains my colourschemes and old fonts.
